## Meta Bind
The Meta Bind plugin allows you to create buttons and text boxes, like the ones used in the Task List.

The use of these fields can be combined with [[Dataview]] and Obsidian commands to get great results.

This is the official repository of the plugin: https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin
