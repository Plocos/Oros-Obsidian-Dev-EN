This note includes typical cases of day-to-day use of the system. You can take them as a reference or example to understand how to use the system.

# Get up to date:
When you start working or studying in the morning, open the vault and check the pending tasks you had for today. You can see this in both the daily note and the to-do list. If you want to check individually, check your project tasks and inbox.

Remember that you can note down personal tasks, work meetings, projects to continue working on, reports to send, etc. More information in [[100 - Inbox]] and [[200 - Projects]].

# Reading a book:

Let's imagine that I am reading Plato's “The Allegory of the Cave”.  To start reading the book, the first thing to do is to create a note using the [[Booksearch]] plugin with the name of the book. The plugin is in the vertical ribbon on the left and from there I search for the name of the book and create the note.

Then I start reading it and when I find a passage that catches my attention or that I want to save, I create a new note and write there the quote corresponding to the book along with the concept or idea I wanted to save.

Logically, as it belongs to the book “The Allegory of the Cave”, by Plato, I write in the field “Related to” of the header a link to the book, it would be something like this: \[[The Myth of the Cave - Plato]]. This way I already have the note linked to his book. Then, in the “Source” field I write the link to the book.

Another way to annotate these passages and concepts is to add the quotes directly into the note created with [[Booksearch]], using it as a “summary” of the book. This speeds up the process, although it reduces the ease of access to those quotes later. Depending on your interests, you may find it useful.

# Make an outline:

In this example, let's imagine that we have read a whole book and we want to make an outline of contents and concepts. In this case, we should use [[330 - Canvas]]. For this you can create blocks with the text and link the different blocks by arrows. If we already have notes created and we want to use them in the canvas, we can directly include them. You can also add images, pdf documents, videos, etc.

# Organize a project:

Suppose you want to go on a trip. This is considered a [[200 - Projects|project]] in most cases, since it requires a series of steps, tasks and efforts that are prolonged over time. For example, packing a suitcase or calling the hotel would be a task.

To begin, create a new project by pressing Control + N, give it a name and start adding the different actions.

If the project is still an idea, leave it in idea for now, but if you are already working on it, put it in active. If you have left a project half done or temporarily discarded it, drag it to inactive. Finished projects, put them under done. To move it from one column to another, simply drag it with the mouse between the different columns.

Once the project is created, we have to create inside it all the actions it has. To do this, click on the 3 vertical dots to the right of the note card and select the “New note from card” option.

With everything created, the project might look like this. Since the project tasks are actions of a kanban, you can add date to them as seen [[100 - Inbox#Other functionalities|here]].

# Search for information
Often, we will be interested in quickly finding a note or a project within our system. This need will increase over time, since it is very complicated to find a specific file by searching through folders when there are thousands of files.

- Quick Search: Control + O
- From the Indexes: Go to [[+ Categories Index]] or [[+ Notes Index]] and consult in the search bar the information according to whether they are categories or notes. Remember that you can access them from the bottom left menu:
![[Home.png]]
- From the “Search” function: At the top right, there is a more powerful function than Quick Search and allows you to filter the information by numerous criteria. It is slower, but also more accurate when we do not know exactly what information we are looking for but we do know some keyword or data.
