## Quickadd
This plugin allows you to create new notes and use macros by using shortcuts. The default shortcut we defined is **Ctrl + N**. If you are interested in templates, you can read more [[431 - Templates|here]].

This is the official repository of the plugin: https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd
