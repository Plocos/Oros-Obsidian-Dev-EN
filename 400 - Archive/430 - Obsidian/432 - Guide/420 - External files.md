## 420 - External files
External files is part of [[400 - Archive|archive]].

This is the folder where you put everything that is not a text file: photos, videos, audios, etc. By default, when you add such a file in *Obsidian*, it automatically goes to this folder. 

However, it is highly recommended that you then sort your files by type according to your needs. The Oros system brings as an example two folders “Documents” and “Images”, make the ones you want and classify them according to your needs. Simply drag the files to their folders.

The documents folder has an interesting feature: use [[Booksearch]] to automatically add [[320 - Notes|notes]] of books you want to read. The [[320 - Notes|notes]] mention sources of information, so you can use the “Source” field to link to the book in PDF or EPUB format.

You can read EPUB documents comfortably inside Obsidian thanks to the [[ePub Reader]] plugin.
