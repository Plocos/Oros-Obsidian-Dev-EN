## Daily note
Daily Note is Obsidian's own add-on that allows you to create a note every day.

To improve its functionalities, [[Calendar]] is used, which allows you to see the daily notes in the upper left panel. Here you can quickly browse through the different daily notes and automatically create notes for other days that do not have their note created yet.
