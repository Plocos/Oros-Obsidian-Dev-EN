## Markdown language

Markdown language is the language that allows you to write in Obsidian. It is the way to write titles, indent, list, write in bold, etc.


### Titles:

They are written with # and a space. Each additional # is a lower level title: #, ##, ###, ###, etc.



### Text formatting:

- **Bold:** Typed by pressing Control + B or with **. 
- **Italic:** Type it by pressing Control + I or with *. 
- **Strikethrough:** Type with ~~ text ~~.
- **Highlight:** Typed with == text ==.

### Links

##### Note links: 
Typed with `[[ ]]`, what is left inside is a link that can be either to an existing note or to a note that does not yet exist, but saves its link for the future. The links can be seen in the graphical view of *Obsidian*.

##### Links to *internet:*

If you press Control + K, it generates this: `[]()`. What is in square brackets is the name of the link, what is in parentheses is the internet address. For example: [Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md).

### External images

You can add images from *internet* via links. Just do the same procedure as Control + K, but add ! in front.

### Lists

You can make lists in Obsidian by typing - , * or + in front of the text. If you prefer to make it by listing the items, just do 1. , 2. , 3. , etc.

For example:
1. Obsidian
2. Obsidian
3. Obsidian
- Obsidian
* Obsidian
+ Obsidian

To add lists within lists just press tab. For example:

1. Obsidian
	1. Obsidian
		1. Obsidian
			1. Obsidian

### Task lists:

You can create tasks by pressing Control + L or by typing - [ ]. For example: 
- [ ] Learn how to use Obsidian

### Footnotes:

You can add annotations by simply typing `[^number]`. Then, footnote the same number:

Learn to use Obsidian[^1]


[^1]: It seems difficult at first, but the effort is worth it.


There are more things to learn, but these are the main ones, everything you need you can consult in the [[Official Obsidian Documentation]].
