## Categories 
A category is a type of note that is only used to link to and classify other notes. They are like the folders in which you classify your notes, they are used to indicate the contents of each topic and their specific location. An interesting thing is that **categories can be linked to other categories, thus creating a hierarchy**. 

For example, we could have a category for the topic: “Baking” and in turn, a category called “Cooking”. “Cooking” encompasses ‘Baking’ and other possible categories such as ‘Kitchen Objects’ or ‘Recipes’. 

Each category would have its own notes, for example: 
1. Cooking (Category) 
2. Confectionery (Category): Types of pastry creams (Note) 
3. Objects (Category): How to use the oven (Note) 
4. Recipes (Category): Recipe of sponge cake (Note)

#### Best practices
To encourage the good use of categories, we recommend these best practices, which will help you get the most out of them:

- The name of the categories should always be a noun or, failing that, a concept. “Pastry” or ‘String Theory’ are appropriate names, while ‘Walking’ or ‘During’ are not.
- If a category has too many linked notes (we recommend 100 as the maximum number), it is advisable to divide it into subcategories. If you have 150 notes linked to the “Math” category, you may need to create some subcategories such as “Arithmetic” or “Trigonometry” to better organize yourself.
- When creating a new category, try to predict and create the subcategories you will need. It is preferable to have leftover subcategories and delete them over time, since what is recommended in the previous point can sometimes be tedious, but you should always keep a logical limit (creating a category for every noun in the dictionary would not be functional). 

With experience, creating categories will be a very intuitive process and will help you to better understand your interests.
