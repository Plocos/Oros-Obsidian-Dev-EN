Resources, their creation, linking and maintenance, in Oros are managed by the Zettelkasten method.The _Zettelkasten_ method is a method for taking notes and managing your knowledge. Its peculiar name comes from two German words: _Zettel_ (note) and _kasten_ (drawer).

### Types of notes

There are variations, but a classic _Zettellkasten_ has 4 types of notes. In our case, we have simplified the system into categories and notes, keeping the functionalities and facilitating the daily use and understanding. In addition, there are Canvas, dashboards that allow you to visualize information and create diagrams.

### Best Practices
#### Connectivity

Beyond the connection with categories, link notes that you see that are related (one idea is the consequence of another, is its result, is an opposite argument, a complementary data...).

#### Atomicity

A note should normally contain only one complete and simply explained idea. You can find examples in [[320 - Notes| Notes]]

Sometimes it will be interesting to create notes that serve as a summary. In these cases, we recommend that the summary sticks to a specific topic, avoiding dispersion. You can even make sure that your summary only focuses on the content of one category to avoid digressing too much. 

#### Revisit your notes
Reading an old note often creates mental connections to other knowledge you didn't have when it was created. This can increase creativity and facilitate the creative process.

#### Be brief
Explain in your words and in a simple way the ideas.

This will make the information more memorable. Also, the effort of having to simply explain a concept will make you understand the topic much better than if you had just copied it. It is not a matter of copying and pasting text.

We consider a concept understood when you could explain it to a small child.
