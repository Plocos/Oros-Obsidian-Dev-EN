## 441 - Templates

Templates are elements of the system that allow you to create notes in a quick and homogeneous way, so that they all have the same common style.

#### Usage
To create a file using a template, use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + N**. In case you want to change this setting, go to Settings -> Keyboard shortcuts -> QuickAdd: RunQuickAdd.

#### Operation details

Templates are used with [[Quickadd]] and [[Templater]] and have in their style some static (they will always be the same) and dynamic (every time you use the template it changes differently) parts. For example, the templates containing:{{title}}, means that when you create a new note, where {{title}} is written, the name of the note will appear automatically.

In addition, the notes in the header have a number of properties. It is recommended to fill them in, so the information will be sorted and it will be easier to work with the information in the future.
