## Canvas 
Canvas is an Obsidian feature that allows you to make simple diagrams. 

You can use it to make concept maps, diagrams, decision trees, flowcharts, etc.... It also allows you to visualize your notes as if they were a whiteboard. This is useful to see your notes all together at a glance if you are a person who prefers visual learning. 

It also allows you to add external information such as videos, pictures, links, pdf documents, etc.
