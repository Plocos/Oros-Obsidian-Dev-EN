## Booksearch
Booksearch allows you to create [[320 - Notes]] about books in a very fast way. To use it, we have to click in the book image, placed in the left sidebar of the app. Then, you have to type the name of your desired book.

You can change the language of the searched books in the settings of the plugin. Settings > Booksearch.

> [!Note]+
> This plugin DONT gives you the content of the searched books, it only creates a note that references the book to make the information save process faster.

This is the official repository of the plugin: https://github.com/anpigon/obsidian-book-search-plugin
