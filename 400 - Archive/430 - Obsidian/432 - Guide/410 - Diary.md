## 410 - Diary
The diary is part of the [[400 - Archive|archive]] and consists of 4 parts:

1. **Today's tasks**: Here will be shown all the actions you have scheduled for that day in your different [[Kanban]]. In addition, the overdue and future tasks will be shown.
2. **Title of the day**: Write a title by which this day will be remembered in the future.
3. **Rating**: Add a rating of how much you enjoyed the day. We recommend a scale of 1 to 5, but you can use any scale you like.
4. **Summary of the day**: Write here what the day has been like, it is a normal diary, feel free. Also, you can add tags or links about the topics related to the day and add your mood as a tag (later, you will be able to see how many days you have been happy or sad).

The diary has a template ([[(Template) D Diary Note]]), which is activated using [[Quickadd]] or using [[Calendar]].
