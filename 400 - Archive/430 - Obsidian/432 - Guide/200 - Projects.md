## [[+ Projects Kanban|Projects]]
Projects **projects** at Obsidian represent large long-term efforts, whether personal or professional, with a defined objective. They can range from renovating a bathroom to completing a course, developing an application or creating a company. For example:

- Completing the design of a website
- Buying a new computer
- Write a report
- Renovate the bathroom
- Finish an English course
- Rearrange living room furniture

### Project statuses

The Kanban board allows you to clearly see the status of each project, and within each project, the status of each task. This simplifies time and resource management. By default, the available statuses are:

- **üí≠ Idea**: Projects in planning or in queue.
- **‚è© Active**: Projects currently in execution.
- **‚è∏ Inactive**: Projects currently paused.
- **‚úîÔ∏è Done**: Completed projects. We do not recommend deleting completed projects too early, as they usually contain a lot of relevant information.

### How does it works?

1. **Creation**: Projects are added to the main Kanban board ([[+ Projects Kanban|Projects Kanban]]).
2. **Detail**: Each project has its own more detailed Kanban, where specific tasks are listed. We can see how they are created in the gif at the top of this note.
3. **Display**: The main dashboard provides an overview of all projects, while the individual dashboards allow a closer tracking of the tasks of each project.

### Creating Projects and Tasks

To add a new project or task, use the key combination **Control + N** or create a card within the [[+ Projects Kanban|Projects Kanban]]. After creating the card, click on the three dots and on the ‚ÄúNew note from card‚Äù option, as shown in the gif.

### Subprojects
In the case of a very large project, the system allows you to create subprojects. You only have to create a card within a project and follow the steps indicated in the previous section.

For example, the development of this vault is a project that, for the moment, contains 2 subprojects (Oros Obsidian and Oros). Each of these subprojects contains several subprojects that refer to the different versions of each system.
