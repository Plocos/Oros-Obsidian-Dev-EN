## Tag Wrangler
This plugin allows the user to use and modify tags in a more efficient way than the Obsidian one. Some of the functionalities are:

- Open or create a tag page.
- Rename a tag (and subtags).
- Search files filtering by tag.
- Add tags as a search requirement to the current search.
- Remove tags as a search requirement to the current search.
- Contract all the tags in tha same level.
- Expand all the tags in tha same level.

This is the official repository of the plugin: https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler
