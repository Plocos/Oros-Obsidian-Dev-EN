### What tasks should be noted in the inbox?

The **inbox** is a repository for any task that we need to do later and that is not too large. In case you want to store a more complex task, you can refer to the use of [[200 - Projects]].

The sources where tasks are extracted usually range from physical notes to e-mails to instant messages. Some more specific examples are:
- If you agreed on an appointment for a day in a *Whatsapp* conversation, take it to your [[+ Inbox|inbox]].
- If you were walking down the street and found a restaurant you would like to go to another day, take it to your [[+ Inbox|inbox]].
- If you've been told you have to run a series of errands, take them to your [[+ Inbox|inbox]].


### Task statuses

The Kanban board allows you to clearly see the status of each task, simplifying time and resource management. By default, the available statuses are:
- **üì¶ Queue**: Add here the new tasks you note in the inbox.
- **‚åõÔ∏è Waiting**: A task is waiting when it does not depend on you, either because it cannot be done yet (you are waiting) or because you have delegated it (someone else is taking care of it, it is not your business). Some examples are a meeting next week or an electronic device that you send to be fixed.
- **‚úîÔ∏è Done**: Drag here the tasks you have finished. You can also delete them when you think you have too many or when you think you won't need them again.

### Other functionalities

- **Dates and deadlines:** Tasks can have due dates assigned to them, which helps you prioritize and meet deadlines. You can add them as shown in the gif at the top of this note.

- **Integration with daily note and to-do list:** Scheduled tasks automatically appear in the daily note and to-do list, providing an overview of what needs to be done each day.
