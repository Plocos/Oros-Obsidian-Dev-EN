## Notes 
Notes are the pieces of information that make up all our knowledge. In their format we find a “Related to” field to connect them to categories or projects, a “Source” field to cite their source or origin, and an empty space for writing. You are free to use them as you wish, but for optimal use, we recommend that each note contains only one of these three options: 

- Through the source field, link to an interesting external resource (video, web page, contact, document...).
- Brief definition of a concept.
- Text developed from a series of concepts and reflections, similar to a summary.

Finally, we recommend other good practices for the preparation of notes:

- Don't skimp on creating notes that reference a source. If you find something interesting, capture it.
- When jotting down concepts, ideas, mathematical formulas, definitions... try to be brief, the more concrete and shorter the information, the better. Remember to use [[Latex Suite]] and [[Chem]] to create your mathematical and chemical formulas.
- When you are going to write reports, reflections, summaries, guides, researches... remember to use links to the concepts or resources you need when writing that long note mentioned above.

This way you will be able to create a network of interconnected knowledge that facilitates learning and memorization.
